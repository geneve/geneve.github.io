# Overview
This is a project for IT Project Management class for the last semester of my undergraduate studies. This would have to be the most demanding project I have ever done in my whole college life (adding outside responsibilities). The goal was essentially to determine the application of learning chapters for each week and establish a deliverable according to what was outlined in the lectures. Weekly touch-base meetings with the group was essential to the success of this project. The final project was the accumulation of all the weeks' work plus a final presentation of our ideas. 

We have chosen ["GoKart Racer"](https://www.gokartracer.com/) to do our analysis on because of our team's involvment with the company and the knowledge of the recent expansion to Sacramento. We essentially, as acting pro-bono consultants, gathered  information from several resources (including owner Dave) to come to helpful conclusions.

Ultimately, this project was really fun and very rewarding. Our professor couldn't help but give us an "A" for all the hard work.

The main deliverables for the project included:

* Business Case
* Project Infrastructure
* Scope Management Plan
* Work Breakdown Structure
* Project Schedule and Budget
