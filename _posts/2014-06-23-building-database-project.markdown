# Overview
This past spring I had the oppurtunity to take a Database Management class at SF State. For our final project, we were tasked to design and construct a database for some organization (real or imaginary). Our grade heavily depended on intelligent use of concepts that we learned throughout the semester. The deliverables for this project included:
*  A three-page text write-up
*  An E-R diagram showing entities, attributes, relationships, primary keys, foreign keys, cardinalities, and min/max constraints (handwritten on original document)
*  A schema of relations showing primary keys, foreign keys, and referential integrity
*  A set of three text files of SQL statements that 1) build, 2) load, and 3) query our database; and finally
*  A logfile that shows the results of running our text files

## Team
It was an awesome experience working with two (originally three) awesome classmates on this project. I felt like every time we met, I learned something new. Details for these two group mates can be found on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/genevereyes) profile under "Projects".

## Learning Experience
Prior to this class, I only learned of database concepts as subunits in prior Information Systems classes. Being able to actually learn concepts from best design practices for data integrity, to writing  advanced SQL queries made me realize that there's much to learn. So I did. As a part of my quest to learn tech, I hopped on Coursera's ["Introduction to Database"](https://class.coursera.org/db) class to further my understanding.
