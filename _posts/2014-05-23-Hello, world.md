# Dabbling
It's been a couple of months since I've started dabbling into HTML and CSS. I was just trying to get a static site going for my [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) web server, at first. I didn't think I'd open up a can of worms.

##Summer
The spring semester just ended and I'm determined to embark on a summer full of code. I suppose I will blog my progress the entire time. I'm sure it will be fun.
