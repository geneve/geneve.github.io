# Overview
This is the final project for my Business Strategy senior seminar class. The main objective of this project is to apply strategies learned in class to a real-world business case. My group and I chose to do Whole Foods Market because it was easily accesible to all of us and also for our overall experience with the company. This is a whole-semester project that requires the following deliverables:

* Interim Report - explain issues as a theoretical consultant / perform internal and external analyses
* Environment Analysis Report - visit company headquarters or branches to invesitage internal and external 
* Final Report - apply all learning modules to an 15-page report
* Final Presentation - present all information gathered and strategic decisions to theretical CEO (in-class)
