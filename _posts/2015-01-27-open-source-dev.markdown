# Overview
This is a project for an elective class in the Information Systems department. The goal of this project is to create an open source web app using the learning modules used throughout the semester. The project requires that the group create a *dynamic* app that is based on a real world problem or idea. Another requirement is that the app should be reliant on queries to a NoSQL database. The phases for this project are outlined below:

* Phase I - Proposal
* Phase II - Systems Design
* Phase III - Prototype
* Phase V - Final Report

## Learning Experience
This elective class was not required for me to take in order to graduate. But because I was interested in learning more about web development--specifically open source web development, I decided to dig deeper through this class. I was introduced to a team of talented individuals and was fortunate enough to have a working project at the end of it all.
